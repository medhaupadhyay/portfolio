<summary>Nobel Prize Trends <a href="https://github.com/medhaupadhyay/Nobel-Prize-Trends/tree/main"> (Project Website!)</a></summary>
Alfred Nobel was a Swedish scientist and industrialist; he was most well-known for inventing dynamite. When he died in 1896, he bequeathed all his assets to be used for the establishment of five prizes in the fields of Physics, Chemistry, Physiology (now known as Medicine), Literature, and Peace. The first Nobel prizes were awarded in 1901 and a sixth prize for Economics was added in 1968. While the process of deciding a winner differs slightly for each category, a large chunk of the decision-making happens within the Nobel Committee. This dashboard explores various trends among Nobel prize winners, especially surrounding the number of winners over time, the gender of the winners, and the countries that the winners are from. This dashboard utilizes data spanning from 1901 to 2022. <br>

<summary> UCSD’s Acceptance of Controversial TikToker shows Administration’s Disregard Toward Indian Women </summary>
Even now, it’s difficult for me to describe the way my stomach dropped when I first heard that Avaneesh Kanala was coming to UC San Diego. At first glance, Kanala might seem like an average UCSD transfer student, but a quick search of his name will pull up the TikTok account where he spews racist and misogynistic “hot takes” to over 350,000 followers. I’ve had the misfortune of seeing his videos on my “For You Page” for the past couple years, but the thought of him coming here was truly gut-wrenching. <br>
<img src="https://github.com/medhaupadhyay/portfolio/assets/81603081/eee191eb-a0cf-4dd4-8e25-720e794e3f25" > 
<br>
Kanala’s videos reduce women to mere objects, belittling everything about them from their bodies to their education to their culture, with targeted attacks on his female classmates. This kind of hateful content has always been aimed at people like me: Indian women who aspire to be independent and intelligent. For the past few years, Kanala’s TikTok content has been a painful but bearable rabbit hole that I would occasionally be sucked into. But now I am seeing demons from my screen materialize as Kanala steps onto the UCSD campus. My school has taken someone who can kindly be described as a troll, and presented them in the flesh; am I wrong to see this as a stinging betrayal? <br>
I know that in the real world, there are battles that I will lose. There will be people who will spew hatred at me and try to push me down. But here? On my home turf? This is a knife in my back, a sinking feeling in my stomach. It is a loss of trust, a broken promise.  <br>
<img src="https://github.com/medhaupadhyay/portfolio/assets/81603081/0a577368-d8ae-45c5-8dcc-0c8a11f54eaa" > <br>
I have always believed UCSD when they claimed that this is “an inclusive community where all have the opportunity to thrive,” but the acceptance of Kanala has left me questioning the purity of their ideals. Until now, I considered this school a safe place, a place where my classmates and I would be protected and uplifted. The inclusive community here is one of the first things I bring up when people ask about my favorite parts of UCSD. I tell them how I turned down other schools because I didn’t want to be surrounded by toxic clout chasers who put down other people in some sort of twisted game. I tell them that UCSD promised me a place where I would be respected — where I would be valued. <br>
 One case cannot make or break the culture of an entire university, but UCSD bringing a student like this onto campus would make their stance on inclusion infinitely clearer than thousands of memos ever could; after all, what good is a school that goes on and on about making sure that everyone “feels included in campus life” and then turns around and provides a welcome to someone who is actively spreading hateful and prejudiced messaging? Will the school only take action after these kinds of posts lead to physical violence against women? And what about the other hidden incels at UCSD who will take Kanala’s acceptance at UCSD as a green light for their own brands of misogyny and sexual violence? One case can easily serve as the straw that breaks the camel’s back. <br>
<img src="https://github.com/medhaupadhyay/portfolio/assets/81603081/5432011d-bc1b-4582-8311-43d0e28cdce6" > <br>

Kanala has also complained that “brown TikTok teamed up to get [him] kicked out of Purdue.” In this case, he is referring to the South Asian community on tiktok, many of whom claim that he was facing multiple sexual assault allegations. <br>
Whether Kanala was expelled from Purdue or left of his own volition, he is placing the blame on a mass grassroots uprising. While the details of his situation are not publicly available, it is not unreasonable to believe that all those people had a strong reason to push him out of school. If he was truly “kicked out” of Purdue as he claims, why has UCSD welcomed him here? Has he made amends for his actions? <br>
<img src="https://github.com/medhaupadhyay/portfolio/assets/81603081/6331d7f8-fdd9-4eb0-a664-0dbf09630b18" > <br>

The administration has welcomed this man onto our campus, given him a dorm and a seat in our classes. But how are we, as students, supposed to welcome him into our Triton community? How do we make space for him without pushing out the Indian women that he has been actively undermining? I don’t think we can. I think that a line has been drawn in the sand and we must choose sides. <br>
I can rest easier knowing that many will choose the clearly correct side, and it is comforting to see students leaping to denounce Kanala’s actions. Although it’s heartwarming to see everyone coming together like this, we all know that administration’s acceptance of Kanala reigns supreme. The truth of the matter is that UCSD’s acceptance of Kanala is serving as a strong form of validation for his hateful rhetoric. While this may not have been their intention, UCSD send the message that this student is a respectable citizen who lives by the Triton values. This, in turn, creates an uncomfortable, and potentially unsafe, environment for Indian women at UCSD. <br>
To be absolutely clear, I do not know Avaneesh personally, nor am I advocating for any specific action to be taken against him. All I have to say is that I am deeply disappointed in my school. Something in our Triton community has broken, and I’m afraid it may be irreparable. <br>

<summary>  TikTok is Selling Music Lovers the Illusion of Choice </summary>
 TikTok has established itself as a breeding ground for a whole new type of social media content, one that relies heavily on music. But rather than finding “new” music on TikTok, we’re just being fed the same thing over and over again until our brain starts to tell us that it might not sound so terrible after all. TikTok doesn’t make good music famous; it makes certain types of music famous. <br>
  <img src="https://github.com/medhaupadhyay/portfolio/assets/81603081/59d89197-6334-40e8-9397-ac3028ec1dd5" > <br>
TikTok music leans heavily into a few niche categories. Aside from songs that are good for dancing, one such category is songs with catchy lyrics. These songs are very useful as the soundtrack for the short stories common on TikTok. For example, the lines “for all of my pretty, and all of my ugly too” from Grande’s “pov” were commonly used for people to show themselves looking — you guessed it — pretty and ugly. Songs with fun beat drops have also found a place on TikTok. The beat drop in songs like “Candy,” “ily” and “Somebody That I Used to Know” are commonly used as a soundtrack to short stories or compilations. <br>
Inherently, TikTok has served to severely narrow the scope of songs that can become popular; if your song doesn’t fit into one of these categories, good luck getting anyone to listen to it. On the flip side, if your song does fit into one of these categories, you’ve suddenly and exponentially increased the odds of it becoming mainstream.   <br>
When a song goes viral, it’s suddenly being blasted into people’s ears every time they visit TikTok. And this serves to create the impression that millions of people are obsessed with the song, and it must, therefore, be good. <br>
This is a tantalizing shortcut to fame and therefore money that is understandably difficult for artists to ignore. Though there will always be artists who prioritize fame over art, TikTok’s rigid “genres” are incredibly tempting for singers, who are always at the risk of being left behind when the tide turns. <br>
When artists start prioritizing fame over art, we all suffer. By curating simple trends, TikTok has effectively made it harder for different types of music to rise up by incentivizing artists to make their music fit into boxes. So despite our best intentions, TikTok has turned into a playground for record labels to pump out formulaic music designed to go viral — and it’s working. From Billie Eilish’s “Therefore I Am” to Dua Lipa’s “Don’t Start Now” to Jason Derulo’s “Savage Love,” mainstream artists are all rushing to get a piece of the TikTok pie by adding quirky lyrics and beat drops and planning elaborate dances for fans to copy. <br>
But does popularity really equal merit? Just because a song happens to fit into one of these categories, is it something that I should actually listen to? Must I hear the same three songs every time I turn on my phone? The whole reason that the internet is touted as an equalizer is that it gives the listener a choice. We are no longer bound to the singers that record labels choose. And yet, it feels like we’re somehow going backwards in terms of diversity as far as music is concerned. Am I really supposed to believe that a song is good just because it lends itself well to dice rolling? It can be said that this trend is isolated to TikTok, but it’s tough to be an isolated trend when TikTok has more than 1,000,000,000 users across 150 countries. <br>
With more and more people turning to social media for entertainment, TikTok stands poised to seriously change the way that we consume content, especially music. As music grows more commercialized, it becomes more and more packaged with the sole purpose of increasing profits. In the past, a large chunk of the power rested in the hands of music industry professionals. Now, social media is increasingly snatching at their clout. <br>
Rather than being at the mercy of corporate producers, we’re now letting trends and algorithms determine what we listen to. Though letting any “higher ups” dictate the flow of art is questionable, it can be argued that taking the reigns of music from professional musicians and handing it to social media influencers is a bit of a downgrade. <br>
But then again, what do I know? At the end of the day, TikTok is supposed to be a fun platform for people to share their creativity. Just make sure it isn’t your one-stop shop for new music. <br>

<summary> Movies Have Always Been Political; People Just Weren't Paying Attention </summary>
Last Friday’s epic finale to “The Falcon and the Winter Soldier” finally made it official: Anthony Mackie’s Sam Wilson is the new “Captain America.” Unsurprisingly, the decision — and the show in general — has sparked a wave of criticism. While some of the uproar surrounding the show was blatantly racist, a lot of people took the chance to air out their grievances with the media becoming “too woke.” This frustration is not unique to “The Falcon and the Winter Soldier”; over the past few years, an increasing number of people are uncomfortable with what they deem an unnecessary insertion of politics into their entertainment and are bemoaning the death of escapist cinema. This complaint, however, is insanely strange. The thing is, movies are always political if the audience chooses to watch them with a political gaze. Movies have always been firmly rooted in reality — the political messaging was just somewhat hidden in order to avoid alienating audiences, and people have gotten complacent in playing along and completely missing the point of these movies. Movies have not suddenly become more political, writers have just stopped hiding their themes behind smoke and mirrors in the hopes that they can reach out and shake even a few of their viewers out of a state of willful ignorance. <br>
  <img src="https://github.com/medhaupadhyay/portfolio/assets/81603081/0485e12d-5261-4269-b608-87292d3acb70" > <br>
Those who claim that the movies they watch are “apolitical,” “escapist,” or “disconnected from reality” are simply not thinking critically about the media they are consuming. If someone were to look at a film with a political lens, they would be hard-pressed to find many movies that are truly apolitical. The trick is that the political messaging of films was often disguised for an unwitting or unreceptive audience. For example, “Zootopia” made powerful arguments about racial stereotyping, policing, and the repercussions of bigoted government officials while still being a whimsical movie for children. This analysis is not a “hot take” — it is literally the point of the movie. Still, when police officer Judy impulsively grabs a weapon simply because Nick supposedly has violence in his biology, it wasn’t labeled as a political scene. But when Sam is confronted by a cop in “The Falcon and the Winter Soldier,” it is “too woke.” What could possibly be the difference, other than the viewers’ inability to understand the simple metaphor presented in “Zootopia?” The truth is that most people consider movies to be frivolous entertainment because they only engage with media at the shallowest level possible. And honestly, there is usually nothing wrong with that. There is absolutely no requirement to analyze every movie with critical thought. So, “The Falcon and the Winter Soldier” made it easy for the audience. They did away with a lot of the metaphors and made it easier to understand the story they were trying to tell. <br>
Technically, the viewer can still choose to keep their head in the sand. If someone can’t understand that “Avatar” is a searing critique of colonialism and capitalism, then there is no reason for them to take away anything political from Sam Wilson telling world leaders to provide aid to refugees in “The Falcon and the Winter Soldier.” Everything that happened in the show is fiction. It is only political if the audience takes the fictional story and draws parallels to what is going on around them. And that is the viewer’s personal decision. <br>
As far as the new “Captain America” being Black, simply including people of color in movies is not political. Why is the very existence of non-white people considered a “heavy” topic that takes away from entertainment? “Captain America” is still a superhero franchise with witty jokes, silly banter, and fast-paced fight scenes. Nothing has inherently changed. “The Falcon and the Winter Soldier” is no more and no less political than every other “Captain America” movie. People that glossed over the clear messaging in the original trilogy have no business complaining about this new phase. No one said that the audience has to feel a certain way after watching anything, but viewers who look at a Black man speaking candidly and decide that it’s all a plot to further some sort of an agenda are ruining it for themselves. Rather than feeling inspired or moved, they’re twisting a glorious moment into something it’s not. <br>
People who want their entertainment to remain apolitical simply have to continue letting the themes fly over their heads. Aside from the point that it is a privilege to “take a break” from politics, fiction is only “escapist” as long as the viewer chooses not to connect the story with real life. Movies that are labeled “too woke” are slapped with that label because the writers chose not to engage with complicated metaphors and dialogue that can be interpreted in multiple ways — they chose to make the themes obvious so that it might smack a few of the people who insisted on ignoring anything that was even slightly veiled. <br>
Recently, it’s become increasingly difficult for people to miss the parallels between the stories they consume and the world outside their door. In the past, these parallels were buried; now they’re being showcased more openly. From “The Invasion of the Body Snatchers” to “Hunger Games” to “Transformers,” political motifs have been a staple in fiction for ages. They’re just getting harder to ignore in today’s day and day. <br>
Films* have always tackled the real-world problems that society is facing, but it has always been up to the audience to make the connections. Just because “The Falcon and the Winter Soldier” wrote it out in bold doesn’t change the fact that the message has always been there; some people just chose not to see it. <br>
*The word movie was thrown around a lot in this article, but the audience should be acutely aware that Sam Wilson did not, in fact, wield the shield on the big screen. All of this “wokeness” happened in the confines of Disney+. Disney made a leap by giving the mantle of Captain America to a Black Man, but there is plenty of room for them to backtrack and fumble the progress they’ve made so far. <br>

<summary> "Taylor's Version" Sets Powerful Precedent for Music Industry </summary>
Taylor Swift’s re-recording of her albums, fondly known as "Taylor's Versions", is her latest push to make the music industry a better place, especially for vulnerable artists. Swift is hardly the first artist to face devastation at the hands of their record label, but she might very well be the first one to fight it so openly. What the public views as a catfight between high-profile celebrities is essentially a battle for her life’s work; the very work that the media continues to claim is too personal. In between slut-shaming her, the public continues to claim that Swift is a money-hungry vulture who masterminded every controversy surrounding her in order to increase profits.   <br> 
    <img src="https://github.com/medhaupadhyay/portfolio/assets/81603081/8bebdbe3-7f07-4052-a08b-4636b9790de6" > <br>

It is completely beside the point to argue that Swift does not need the extra money from her rerecordings – what she is doing is setting a precedent. <br>
She has expressed her belief that artists should have the rights to their work, or at least be given the opportunity to buy them back at market value, and she is acting on it. It may not make a huge financial difference for Swift, but it could mean the world for a struggling artist—just like her groundbreaking work in pushing Spotify and Apple Music to pay artists more. Even back then, she was one of few big-name artists who took a stance and stuck to it. At every step, Swift has pushed to make the music industry a better place. Somehow, society has normalized punishing Taylor Swift just for being herself and telling her truth. <br>
 This anti-Taylor sentiment peaked in 2016, with the #TaylorSwiftIsOverParty. Coming off of an iconic high with her album 1989, the public decided that they had enough of Swift and turned on her rapidly. Between her new feud with the Kardashian-West clan and her breakup with Calvin Harris and subsequent rebound with Tom Hiddleston, the media frenzy was out for blood. <br>
 In her Netflix documentary about this tumultuous time period, “Miss Americana”, Swift shares her struggles with an eating disorder, the invasive media coverage of her life, her legal sexual assault battle, and her battle to speak out for what she believed in politically. Each and every one of these issues brought an avalanche of criticism onto her, not to mention the casual sexism she has been forced to endure throughout most of her career. Buried under all of this, Swift was at the cusp of becoming a relic of the past. <br>
And yet she didn’t. Swift pushed back, reinventing herself once again with the edgy “Reputation”. Despite claims that she was no longer relatable, Swift went on to put together a visually stunning stadium tour that made millions. All this to say that Swift is no stranger to the crowds turning on her. <br>
The latest disparagement surrounding Swift’s re-recordings probably won’t be enough to deter this talented and hard-working artist, but just because Swift doesn’t let the mud-slinging drag her down doesn’t mean that it’s harmless. There is nothing cool about undermining a driven artist who is putting themself on the line in order to pave the way for future generations. <br>
It’s inevitable that Swift will go down in history as one of the defining artists of this generation; it’s time for the public to get behind her. Even people who think they don’t like Swift’s music should check out her re-recordings — Taylor’s discography is truly wide enough to please everyone. Swift has always been both a talented artist and one who is working to make the industry a better place; she never disappoints, and it’s about time we stopped letting her down.

<summary> Bringing South Asians to Hollywood is an Uphill Battle, but it's One That We Can Win  </summary>
There was a moment during the San Diego Asian Film Festival (SDAFF) screening of Iman Zawahry’s “Americanish” that made me cry. By all means, “Americanish”is a romantic comedy; the story follows two Pakistani-American sisters and their cousin as they navigate the complicated world of marriage while trying to find professional fulfillment. But something about watching Maryam, Sam, and Ameera each find their own version of happily ever after moved me to tears. If you asked me why, I don’t think I could exactly explain it. It was the novelty, I think, of seeing South Asian women finding joy that left me awestruck. It served as confirmation to me that success was whatever I chose to make of it, and that it was something I deserved. It was not at all what I expected, but it was beautiful nonetheless. And that, I think, is how to best describe my experience at SDAFF. Among the jokes, satire, drama, and documentaries, there was an unmistakable undercurrent of bittersweet joy at seeing Asian stories on the big screen. Every movie was an explosive celebration of culture, but the novelty of the experience served as a painful reminder of the lack of Asian representation in today’s media. We’ve heard the word “representation” thrown around a lot in recent years, but rarely do we see it executed successfully. Simply put, art hits differently when you know that every person on the cast and crew is committed to shining the spotlight on underrepresented communities. <br>
   <img src="https://github.com/medhaupadhyay/portfolio/assets/81603081/e7861267-5493-4e46-8b74-dc781c9da215"> <br>
For me, representation meant watching an entire theater light up to “Sheila Ki Jawani” and “Malang” in Geeta Malik’s “India Sweets and Spices.” “India Sweets and Spices” follows UCLA freshman Alia, who is fed up with her uber-rich family and friends’ shallowness and befriends the family who owns the local Indian grocery store. No matter how rich and hypocritical the characters were, I saw my friends and family reflected in Alia’s community. Watching Indian excellence celebrated on screen, glamorously decked out in glittering outfits and luxurious cars, made me proud beyond words. The rich storytelling and the attention to detail felt like a warm hug; reassurance that someone like me could be the star of their own story. To see aspects of my life — albeit exaggerated versions of it — play out on screen was an experience I won’t forget. When I asked Geeta Malik about the personal inspiration behind the film, she reflected on how weekend Indian get-togethers served as a hotbed for culture and community during her childhood, leaving me feeling like she took the words right out of my mouth. Watching Malik address the theater, it felt like a spectacular future was within reach — one where a movie with an all-Indian cast could be a blockbuster.<br>
I felt a similar sense of hope after watching “7 Days.” Taking place right as the COVID-19 pandemic unfolded in March 2020, “7 Days” tells the story of Ravi and Rita, whose painfully awkward first date becomes unexpectedly elongated when the two are forced to quarantine together. From a soulful examination of arranged marriages to a tearful monologue on the cultural importance of the romantic drama “Kal Ho Naa Ho,” Roshan Sethi’s quirky pandemic rom-com was firmly rooted in Indian culture; but it also spoke to universal themes of loneliness and love, confusion and desperation, and the importance of connection. Listening to Sethi explain the creative process that led him to write “7 Days” with his boyfriend Karan Soni while in residency, I intuitively knew that the future of Asian American cinema is in good hands. Sethi and Soni’s process meticulously aimed to capture the internal tug of war between traditional customs and western thinking, and it is the unique kind of story that could only have been written by Asian Americans.<br>
The Asian American immigrant experience is one which values resilience, resourcefulness, and thrift; so it comes as no surprise that Asian American filmmakers have managed to create such wonderful art even in the face of countless obstacles. Bringing Asian culture to the movies has been — and continues to be — an uphill battle, but attending SDAFF made me realize that we still have a fighting chance if we band together. These and many other films from SDAFF will be playing in theaters across the country, where anyone can walk in and experience the beauty and joy of the Asian American experience. I encourage anyone with the opportunity to do so to buy a ticket and show up for these artists. There is no lack of talented Asian filmmakers; there is only a lack of support for their work. Attending SDAFF granted me a vision of what mainstream Asian American art could look like. This world has largely been pushed out of the spotlight, but I can’t wait for the day when it finally takes center stage.

<summary> Kavanaugh Case Reveals Flawed Past </summary>
When Brett Kavanaugh was nominated for the Supreme Court in July 2018, media attention was relatively minimal. This changed, however, when Senator Dianne Feinstein revealed that she had received a letter detailing claims of sexual assault against Kavanaugh from a victim who preferred to remain anonymous. While the decades-old accusation left spectators across the country speechless, it provided a unique lesson for students: mistakes from high school and college can impose unprecedented implications on their futures. <br>
      <img src="https://github.com/medhaupadhyay/portfolio/assets/81603081/890199b2-2135-4537-8ba2-00487b1bf467" > <br>

Days after Feinstein’s revelation, the victim disclosed her identity and made her accusations public. Dr. Christine Blasey Ford shared her experiences via The Washington Post, claiming that Kavanaugh had assaulted her at a high school party in the early 1980s. Two of Kavanaugh’s classmates from Yale University, Deborah Ramirez and Julie Swetnick, also came forward with similar accusations. The confirmation hearing took place in September, a routine procedure that allows senators to interview nominees for the Supreme Court. After the hearing, the Senate Judiciary Committee requested that President Trump order a FBI investigation, which he opened on Sept. 28. During the investigation, proof that Kavanaugh had been a heavy drinker in high school and college surfaced. <br>
“You hear your parents and teachers saying it all the time: don’t do anything you’ll regret in the future,” said sophomore Ibraheem Qureshi. “Now, it suddenly feels real; they may have a point. And now, with the addition of social media, everything you do is online. A lot of people are deleting their social media pages. They don’t want what they posted online in high school to be used against them.” <br>
It may never be clear whether Dr. Ford’s allegations are true or not, but they have nonetheless left an ugly smear on Kavanaugh’s reputation. Even if the accusations of sexual assault are false, the investigation has exposed Kavanaugh’s rowdy behavior in high school and college, revealing that he may have been downplaying his alcoholism. Former classmates came forward with claims that Kavanaugh had been intentionally misleading with his testimony, referring to a 1985 bar brawl that ended with police intervention. Kavanaugh’s actions during high school may not be representative of who he is today, but he is still responsible for their consequences. Many claim that his heavy drinking in school proved that he was not qualified to be a Supreme Court Justice, while others argue that he was unqualified because he had lied under oath about his drinking problems.
<br>
For many students, partying is an irreplaceable part of the high school and college experience. However, teenagers’ ideas of having fun can often border on unsafe or downright dangerous. <br>
“A lot of people think that having a good time is just doing what their friends are doing,” said senior Alicia Wu. “If there is something you enjoy that may come back to hurt you, you should work to change yourself. It’s not just about your record. Rather than something tangible, it’s more about your character; the decisions you make when you’re younger will shape who you become in the future.” <br>
Still, high school and college students often make mistakes; it’s a part of the learning process. Since they are young and inexperienced, it is almost inevitable that they will make bad decisions. However, there is distinction between careless errors and crimes, and the latter may never be forgiven. <br>
“There’s a line between kids being kids and being a bad person,” Qureshi said. “Most of the time when you make a mistake, people are going to hold it against you. You can ask for forgiveness, but you won’t always receive it. Sometimes, people realize that they were wrong, and they are trying to change for the better, but in some cases it’s not possible.”
<br>
Throughout the ordeal, witnesses and investigators across the country stepped in to unearth every piece of evidence about Kavanaugh’s student life. His actions during school posed a serious threat to his career nearly 35 years later. The same could potentially happen to any student, years from today. One seemingly insignificant mishap can have resounding consequences, and high schoolers should be careful to protect themselves from these unintended ramifications. This incident may lead students to monitor their own behavior more closely. On the other hand, it may simply convince students to put up a facade for the people around them. <br>
“I don’t think that the Kavanaugh case is going to force anyone to change,” said World History teacher Nhat Nguyen. “Students might be really good at putting up a front for other people to see, but in private, they are still who they are.”
<br>
 Adding on to the case’s complications, many have wondered whether evidence from so long ago can be considered an accurate representation of a person today. After all, people can change over the course of several years.
<br>
“High school is a really strange period of time for everyone,” Mr. Nguyen said. “It’s hard to see if it really reflects who a person is years later. We need to see if there is anything consistent, if there are any constants. One point in time doesn’t give you any progression, you need more data to see if they’ve changed over time.” <br>
 Whether or not a person changes, it is irrefutable that incidents from high school and college are now acceptable reasons for attacking public figures. High schoolers have been quick to realize that anything they say or do can be used against them. Students may refrain from going down the wrong path if they realize that bad decisions can keep them from accomplishing their long-term goals and aspirations. <br>
“We don’t just live for the moment; we live for our futures and what we will become,” Wu said. “We all have hopes and ambitions. We have to keep ourselves in check with that, and use our goals as motivation to stay away from trouble.”
<br>
 Despite the scandals, Kavanaugh was sworn in to the Supreme Court on Oct. 6. While we may never know whether or not Kavanaugh is guilty, his ordeal battling the ghosts of his past has brought high schoolers a sobering lesson: the past never stays buried.

<summary> Claire's Case Highlights Lack of FDA Oversight </summary>
While looking for makeup, shoppers often consider brand, price and quality. But it may be time to add a new factor: toxicity. In America, where a sense of false security is common among consumers due to the numerous committees and laws dedicated to their protection, most believe that the products they buy have undergone strict examination. This, however, is not always the case.
<br>
        <img src="https://github.com/medhaupadhyay/portfolio/assets/81603081/159bb5f2-0271-4865-95d9-8d71b2cc9fd6" > <br>

 On Dec. 28, Claire’s, a makeup and accessory store, issued recalls for several of its makeup products after Kristiana Warner, a Rhode Island woman, claimed that she had found asbestos in several Claire’s products, including eye shadows, blushes and compact powders. Asbestos is a mineral that was popularly used in building insulation for years, but was proven to be toxic in 1973, and has since been linked with cancer and mesothelioma, a deadly lung disease. Warner mailed her six-year-old daughter’s makeup to the Scientific Analytical Institute, a North Carolina lab that specializes in testing for toxic substances, and the results revealed traces of cancer-causing tremolite asbestos.
<br>
“Harsher regulations, more restricting guidelines [should be put in place],” said art teacher and InDesign club advisor Charlotte Kruk. “That’s a really negative thing. Nothing can have asbestos by today’s standards.”
<br>
 After the recall, Claire’s came forward to say that it had sent its products for testing, and had found these products to be asbestos-free. Despite Claire’s findings, the Scientific Analytical Institute continues to back their own, claiming that the exact product they tested has not yet been re-tested by Claire’s. Additionally, Claire’s has not specified which labs tested their products, which has led many to question the products’ safety.
<br>
 “It is unsafe, if there is even a possibility of asbestos being in the products,” said senior and InDesign club president Christina Chen. “If a person bought makeup, and they are not sure about [what the ingredients are], then it is not fair to them because they are buying something without being told what is in it. If the company is not saying the truth and being honest to their consumers, then it should not be a safe brand that people trust.”
<br>
 Although it is unclear whether or not asbestos was present in the Claire’s products, this case brings to light numerous discrepancies in the Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) regulations. Although the FDA’s job is to protect consumers from potentially dangerous cosmetics, companies are still able to sell products with harmful substances by exploiting loopholes in FDA regulations. Currently, companies can easily avoid sharing the ingredients used in their products by claiming that doing so would give away “trade secrets.” Additionally, the U.S. only bans about ten chemicals in cosmetics while the European Union has over a thousand banned, and consumers are paying for these lax regulations. <br>
“The FDA should intervene in cases like this, as it has the ability to affect many people’s lives” said sophomore Aayushi Jani. “The government should impose stricter regulations because an incident like this should not occur again.”
<br>
 The FDA mainly relies on direct reports from customers in order to launch investigations into potentially harmful products. Even after customers have filed complaints, however, the FDA has no legal authority to recall the product, so it is entirely possible that the harmful products  remain on the market. <br>
“The FDA should impose harsher regulations, more restricting guidelines,” said Kruk. “[Cosmetic] companies should not be allowed to sell dangerous makeup — that’s so terrible.” <br>
 In fact, companies are not even required to forward complaints to the FDA, meaning that such concerns often go ignored, and no changes are made to the product in question. Even terms like “organic” and “hypoallergenic” are unregulated, giving them little to no meaning in the cosmetic industry. <br>
All this may tempt shoppers to throw their makeup out the window, but such drastic measures are not yet necessary. Avoiding fragrances is one way to steer clear of toxins, as it can take hundreds of chemicals to create a single fragrance. Lipsticks are also notoriously known to contain lead, a dangerous neurotoxin. Customers would be well-advised to stay away from ingredients such as mineral oil, parafﬁnum liquidum, petrolatum, petroleum jelly, propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol and polysorbates. These are petroleum derivatives, meaning they are extracted from crude oil. They have a nearly infinite shelf life, and are cheap and abundant, but can also lead to allergies and are known toxins. Parabens, phenoxyethanol and benzyl alcohol are preservatives that can disrupt hormones and nerves. <br>
 “We’re living in a poisonous world,” said Kruk. “I think that with makeup, it’s buyer beware. None of that stuff is good for you. I just wish that the message we were sending our young people is that they are gorgeous without all that nonsense.”
<br>
 While these cautionary steps may seem unnecessary, it is becoming increasingly clear that each consumer must watch out for his or her own health and safety, even if it is something as simple as choosing what makeup products to purchase. Relying solely on government regulations to keep shoppers safe is no longer a viable option.
